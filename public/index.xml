      <description>Introduction This is somewhat just a test post. Several months ago, I looked at how common a sex ambiguous name, “Taylor”, is in the United States by year (1900 - 2000) and by sex.
 Results Prevalence by Year Below are plots that show the proportion (log base 10 transformed) of people named “Taylor” over time. Popularity for the name “Taylor” began rising around the 60s before dipping back down in the 90s.</description>
