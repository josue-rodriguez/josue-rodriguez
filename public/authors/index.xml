      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Josue. I&amp;rsquo;m a fourth year graduate student in Quantitative Psychology at UC Davis and a data scientist at McGraw Hill. When I was younger, I attended Humboldt State University, where I completed a BA and MA in Psychology, along with a minor in statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m interested in developing statistical tools and methods to help social and behavioral scientists better answer the questions they ask. In my current research, I&amp;rsquo;m exploring Bayesian variable selection methods and mixed-effects models. At work, I&amp;rsquo;m helping build longitudinal profiles of students&amp;rsquo; educational journey to personalize learning at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I like to do outside of work include playing and watching sports (mostly basketball and [american] football). I also spend time playing watching and playing chess. At home, I like to try cooking different types of food and experiment with different techniques. Generally, I like activities that allow me to learn new things and continually improve at them.&lt;/p&gt;
