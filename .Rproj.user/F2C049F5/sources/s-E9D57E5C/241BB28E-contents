Hi! My name is Josue (ho-sway), and I am a first year graduate student in Quantitative Psychology at the University of California, Davis. My research interests lie in hierarchical models, longitudinal models, and machine learning methods for social science. Before moving to Davis, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in psychology at Humboldt State University, along with a minor in statistics. Iâ€™m interested in developing statistical tools and methods to help social and behavioral scientists better answer the questions they ask. 

In my spare time I like to watch sports, television, and lift weights.
