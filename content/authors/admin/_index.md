Hi! My name is Josue. I am a second year graduate student in Quantitative Psychology at UC Davis. Prior to beginning my PhD, I attended Humboldt State University where I completed a BA and MA in Psychology, along with a minor in statistics. Iâ€™m interested in developing statistical tools and methods to help social and behavioral scientists better answer the questions they ask. Currently I'm exploring Bayesian hypothesis testing in both mixed effects and network models.

Outside of research, I maintain several interests. I am an avid fan of playing and watching basketball and I enjoy keeping up with the the NFL. Recently, I've also learned how chess pieces move, so I've been trying my hand at that. In my home, I like to try cooking different types of food (if you've never cooked with a wok, I highly recommend it). Generally, I like activities that allow me to learn new things and continully improve at them.
