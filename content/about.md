Hello there! My name is Josue Rodriguez and I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Academic Research in Psychology with a minor in Applied Statistics at Humboldt State University. Within psychology, my research interests include speech perception and production, probabilistic thinking, open science, and how we can apply machine learning techniques to the field of psychology. 

I also enjoy learning about statistics, data science, and programming in R (although I'm learning Python too!). I hope to combine my love for psychology and statistics and enter a PhD program in Quantitative Psychology. 

For now, I am the lab manager for the [Cognition Lab at HSU](https://www2.humboldt.edu/psychology/hands-learning/research-labs/cognition-lab) and an intern at the [HSU Office of Institutional Effectiveness](http://www2.humboldt.edu/irp/).

When I'm not reading or learning to program, you can find me watching NBA basketball, hiking in the forest, or watching Westworld.
