Hello there! My name is Josue Rodriguez and I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Experimental Psychology with a minor in Applied Statistics at Humboldt State University. Within psychology, my research interests include speech perception and production, and uncertainty in social identity. My methodological interests include Bayesian models for behavioral data and how to handle ordinal data.

As data science enthusiast I've developed a passion for programming in R and Python, so starting in Fall 2019 I will have the opportunity to combine my love for statistics, psychology, and data science by entering a PhD program in Quantitative Psychology. Eventually, I will blog about stuff in these fields which I find interesting and awesome. 

Currently, I am the lab manager for the [Cognition Lab at HSU](https://www2.humboldt.edu/psychology/hands-learning/research-labs/cognition-lab) and an editorial assistant for  [Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy ](https://www.spssi.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid=478).

Aside from my academic interests, I like to watch the NBA, visit the local beaches, and lift weights.
